# CoE 197-Z Deep Learning Project 2
### PokeGAN V2
##### The goal of this project is to improve existing experiments on GANs that produce new and unique Pokemon characters. The task of creating these new cartoons could provide inspiration to Pokemon creators in creating new Pokemon characters in the franchise. Also, it can provide excitement to Pokemon lovers knowing that they can create new Pokemon by merging their favorite Pokemons. 

With common problems in existing experiments such as the lack of form of the generated Pokemon and sensibility of the images, the results of the existing experiments will not inspire Pokemon creators and will not provide excitement to Pokemon lovers. Because of this, the proponents propose the use of a new dataset to improve the quality of the output, as well as some changes to the code to be able to train the GAN in less epochs but still produce output with similar or better quality. This has been achieved with a *INSERT ARCHI HERE* architecture that was trained over *INSERT TRAINING EPOCHS HERE* that translates to *INSERT TRAINING TIME HERE* in *INSERT COMPUTER HERE*.

## Outputs
- Outputs per 50 epochs can be found under the **newPokemon** directory.
